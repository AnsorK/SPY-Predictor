# $SPY Predictor üïµÔ∏è
Uncovering correlation within the $SPY ETF using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network in PyTorch. Knowing 60 days of consecutive $SPY close prices allows me to predict the 61st day's close price with 78.05% accuracy*

*Note: Only for 1/2/2024 - 3/1/2024 and allowing for 1% discrepancy

## Charts
Collected historical data on daily $SPY prices from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/history. Data is from January 29th, 1993, to March 8th, 2024.

Trained the model with closing prices from October 7th, 2022, to December 29th, 2023.\
