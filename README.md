# Welcome to $SPY Predictor! üïµÔ∏è
It is a Long Short-Term Model (LSTM) Neural Network to find correlation for the $SPY stock over time!

## How it works
The LSTM Neural Network is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that uses long run and short run values during the training
process. It is particularly designed to address the pitfalls of regular RNN's and work with temporal data.

Collected historical data on daily $SPY prices from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/history. I collected data from January 29th, 1993, to March 8th, 2024. 

The Jupyter notebook has all the cool graphs for the data!

## Note
This has been trained on bull market conditions, and so won't fare well
in a bear market.

Obviously not super complex, but fun to work on.
